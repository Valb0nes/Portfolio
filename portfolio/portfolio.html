            <h1>Adventure TIme 2.0</h1>
            <p class="size">This project we have just finished with. we had two choices to pick from which were a
                digital boardgame or a text adventure. Me and my partner chose the text adventure because we both wanted
                to base it off of anime. So that's exactly what we did. We made pictures thatwent perfectly along with
                the theme of the storyline and dialougue. We also had to create two different flowcharts and a really
                long storyline with many different endings so that it was longer and more enjoyable to play because of
                all the different endings that you can get.</p>

            <h1>Budget Calculator</h1>
            <p class="size">With the budget calculator we had to sit back and tell our classmates whe we wanted to be
                done. everyone had to work for everyone and we ween't allowed at all to code anything in our project. So
                we had to have our classmates do the CSS, HTML, and JS.

            <h1>CSS Zen Garden</h1>
            <p class="size"> With the Zen Garden we got a repository with all of the HTML already done we just had to
                use CSS and make all of that HTML content look pretty. This was a challenge because it was during te
                beginning of the year but it was fun. In the end we had a really cool looking Zen Garden full of the CSS
                that we did on our own.</p>
