    <h1>Jurassic Park</h1>
    <p>This project we did in the middle of the year. Thi was a two partner project. On a place of our choice like resturaunts, fine dining, dress-up and more. We chose a themed dining resturaunt like the one that Disneyland for the princesses. We had to do competitive research and then go onto the HTML and CSS. Overall, this was a really fun projrct to work on.</p>

    <h1>Budget Calculator</h1>
    <p>With the budget calculator we had to sit back and tell our classmates whe we wanted to be done. everyone had to work for everyone and we ween't allowed at all to code anything in our project. So we had to have our classmates do the CSS, HTML, and JS.

    <h1>CSS Zen Garden</h1> 
    <p> With the Zen Garden we got a repository with all of the HTML already done we just had to use CSS and make all of that HTML content look pretty. This was a challenge because it was during te beginning of the year but it was fun. In the end we had a really cool looking Zen Garden full of the CSS that we did on our own.</p>
