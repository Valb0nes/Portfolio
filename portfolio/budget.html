    <p>For the Budget Calculator we had to basically be the boss of our classmates and the other way around. We weren't allowed to code anything for our own projects but instead all of our classmates had to code it for us. We all switched beteween being the "boss" and being the worker basically. When we were being the "boss" we ad to tell them what we wanted to be done and how we wanted that certain thing to look.</p>
