    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>In this project we were tasked with having to make an HTML file look nice by adding our own CSS. So we had already been given an HTMl file that we weren't aloowed to change at all. But instead we had to make all of the CSS. So we got to make the HTML look however we wanted because we didn;t have any limits on what it could look like. We were also given example CSS Zen Garden websites so we could get inspiration.</p>
