                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>In this section I wanted to say some things about me. To start off I am current;y in high school. And
                    I
                    am
                    studying Web Application and development. We are learning how to code websites and games and make
                    them
                    look
                    pretty. After highschool. I want to go to college preferably in Oregon. I want to go to college for
                    architecture. Because I want to become an architect and see my designs come to life. I also want to
                    get
                    experience in other fields of work, so I am open to really trying any type of job and volunteer
                    work.
                    I also want to be able to help and take care of animals. Because I am an animal lover I don't like
                    to
                    see
                    pets being treated badly or put down. I would like to volunteer in a no kill animal shelter sometime
                    in
                    my
                    life if at all possible. I feel like that would be a really good experience for me. And I would be
                    helping
                    animals so it is overall a win win.
                </p>

            <p>Makeup has always been one of my hobbies. Because when I was little I always saw my mom doing her makeup
                and I thought it was cool. So I picked it up and have been doing my makeup ever since.</p>

            <h1>Sketching</h1>
            <p>Sketching is my preferred art medium because you can earase and redo any of the mistakes that you make.
                It's very forgiving. And I don't like coloring in my sketches so I just leave it black and white.</p>
