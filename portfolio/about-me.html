        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>In this section I wanted to say some things about me. To start off I am current;y in high school. And I am
            studying Web Application and development. We are learning how to code websites and games and make them look
            pretty. After highschool. I want to go to college preferably in Oregon. I want to go to college for
            architecture. Because I want to become an architect and see my designs come to life. I also want to get
            experience in other fields of work, so I am open to really trying any type of job and volunteer work.
            I also want to be able to help and take care of animals. Because I am an animal lover I don't like to see
            pets being treated badly or put down. I would like to volunteer in a no kill animal shelter sometime in my
            life if at all possible. I feel like that would be a really good experience for me. And I would be helping
            animals so it is overall a win win.
