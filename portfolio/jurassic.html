    <h1>Summary</h1>
     <p>There were many steps to do in this project. for the first step we had to pick our parters. ten we had to pick what we wanted to theme our website after, like a resturaunt play place etc.. We then had to go and do some competitive research to see what other themed restuaunt websites looked like and offered. After that we started on the code for the actual website, first HTML then CSS. Once we were done we had to make a powerpoint to present to everybody and show off how our website turned out in the end.</p>
