        <p>Hello, my name is Falie Emler. I am currently a high school student studying Web application development at
            The
            Center for Advanced Research and Technology. I also go to Herbert Hoover High school studying general
            education.
            After high school I want to go to college and study Architecure and Design. And after getting my degree I am
            aiming to become an architect. I want to be able to design whatever comes into my head and see it come alive. Because I have a passion for drawing they go hand in hand. I am really excited to persue my passion in architecture and never give up on it. </p>

            Budget Calculator: We had to be directed by our classmates to code their project and we had to direct our
            classmates to code for our project. We werenâ€™t allowed to code almost anything on our own budget
            calculators.
