            <p>Hello, my name is Falie Emler. I am currently a high school student studying Web application development
                at
                The
                Center for Advanced Research and Technology. I also go to Herbert Hoover High school studying general
                education.
                After high school I want to go to college and study Architecure and Design. And after getting my degree
                I am
                aiming to become an architect. I want to be able to design whatever comes into my head and see it come
                alive. Because I have a passion for drawing they go hand in hand. I am really excited to persue my
                passion
                in architecture and never give up on it. </p>
