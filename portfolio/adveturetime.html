            <p class="size">In this text adventure we based everything off of one anime called "The Wrong Way to Use
                Healing
                magic." So all of the storyline and dialougue was based off of this anime's storyline. Me and my
                partner
                worked together to make this project a reality. It cam together really nicely in the end. All of th
                pictures
                fit in with the storyline and the choices that you could make. And the font looked like it belonged
                in the
                same era that the stroy was set in.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="two column">
            <p class="size">This picture shows one of the choices that you can pick. After you pick one of these
                choices the next part of the storyline lets you go off the trail or stay on. But beware don't choose
                the wrong choice.

            <p class="size">This is just a little bit of the JS that we had to do to be able to make all of the
                choices in our story work. We had about 600 lines of code for the JS alone. It was definitely a task
                to make sure that everything worked correctly and was connected.</p>

        <section class="two column">
            <p class="size">This is a really small tid bit of the CSS code that we did. My lovely partner did all of
                the CSS while I worked on th JS. CSS is what makes the website actually look like soemthing instead
                of virtually nothing because we had almost no HTML.</p>
